On May 20, 2024, I had the honor of representing CLADEM/Brazil at the United Nations CEDAW Committee review of Brazil's compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

## The Critical Moment

This presentation came at a crucial time for Brazilian women, as the country faced increasing challenges to women's rights and gender equality. The CEDAW review provided an essential opportunity to bring international attention to these urgent issues.

## Key Issues Addressed

During my intervention at the Opening Session with Brazilian Non-profit Organizations before the CEDAW Committee, I highlighted several critical areas:

### Violence Against Women
- Alarming rates of femicide and domestic violence
- Inadequate implementation of the Maria da Penha Law
- Institutional violence in the justice system

### Reproductive Rights Under Threat
- Attacks on abortion access and reproductive autonomy
- Maternal mortality, particularly affecting Black and indigenous women
- Barriers to comprehensive sexual education

### Economic Justice
- Gender pay gaps and occupational segregation
- Informal work and social protection gaps
- Impact of austerity measures on women

## The Power of International Advocacy

This appearance before the CEDAW Committee demonstrates the crucial role that civil society organizations play in:

- Providing alternative narratives to government reports
- Amplifying the voices of marginalized women
- Creating international pressure for domestic policy changes
- Building transnational solidarity networks

## Looking Forward

The CEDAW review process continues to be a vital tool for advancing women's rights in Brazil and across Latin America. Through sustained advocacy and international cooperation, we can work toward a future where all women can live free from discrimination and violence.

This intervention represents part of ongoing efforts to leverage international human rights mechanisms to protect and advance women's rights at the national level.
