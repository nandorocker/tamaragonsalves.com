This groundbreaking publication examines the misuse of parental alienation concepts in Latin American and Caribbean legal systems, revealing how this pseudo-scientific theory has become a weapon against mothers and children experiencing domestic violence.

## Key Findings

The research demonstrates how parental alienation has been weaponized in custody disputes, often:

- Silencing mothers who report domestic violence
- Placing children at risk by forcing contact with abusive fathers
- Undermining evidence-based approaches to child protection
- Creating institutional violence against women through legal systems

## International Impact

This work has gained recognition from international human rights bodies and has been instrumental in challenging the legitimacy of parental alienation theory before:

- United Nations treaty bodies
- Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
- Regional feminist organizations

## Academic and Legal Significance

The publication bridges feminist legal research with transnational activism, providing crucial evidence for advocates working to protect women and children from institutional violence disguised as "child welfare."

This research has been featured in multiple interviews and has informed policy discussions across the region, contributing to a growing international movement to challenge harmful custody practices that endanger vulnerable families.
