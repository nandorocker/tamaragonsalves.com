        <h3>Gender 305 Podcast</h3>
        <h4>Podcast series on Gender and Human Rights.</h4>

        <p>In the fall of 2022 and 2023, I taught Gender and International Human Rights at the Gender Studies Department
            at UVIC. Under my supervision and with technical support offered by CFUV, the final assignment for the
            course
            was the production of one podcast episode on gender and international human rights. Students could choose
            any
            topic related to this overarching subject.</p>

        <p>Now, in partnership with CFUV, we are publishing and airing the episodes, which cover a broad scope, ranging
            from the right to abortion, rights of LGBTQ2+ and non-binary individuals, gender-based discrimination and
            Artificial Intelligence, gender-based violence against Indigenous women in Canada and much more.</p>

        <p>Please share with the ones who might be interested, tune in, and join the conversation! </p>
